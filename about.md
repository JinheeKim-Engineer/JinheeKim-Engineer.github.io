I am Jinhee Kim, a Master's student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), where I am advised by Prof. Seong-Woo Kim at the [Autonomous Robot Intelligence Lab](https://arisnu.squarespace.com/). I received my B.S. in Mechanical Systems Engineering from Sookmyung Women's University in 2025. 

My research primarily focuses on Multi-Robot Systems, Affordance-aware navigation, and Language-grounded robotics.
